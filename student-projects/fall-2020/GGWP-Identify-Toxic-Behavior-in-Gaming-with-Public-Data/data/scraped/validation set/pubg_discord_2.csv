53,SteveTheHappy🐳#0001,"> I’m going to ask again. Who’s bright idea was it to decide that stats for games on Paramo weren’t recorded? I mean, why?!? Also, by making one map in a separate queue to every other map, you’ve INCREASED queues 🤦🏼‍♂️ And why no solo or duos on the map?!? Genuinely, I question the intelligence of the people making these decisions. It’s absolutely preposterous that you think you’re improving things.
<@490548703208144906> 
Release of Paramo is an experimental way of doing seasonal content which is why it's in the separate queue we call labs. It was decided to be only released in squads because squads is the most played gamemode by far compared to others so it would have the least impact on splitting the playerbase/increasing queue times. Insulting others intelligence because you disagree on their decisions is not constructive. We welcome any and all feedback and read it all, but we do not welcome insulting or toxic behavior.",2020-10-30T10:28:27.793000+00:00

And yes, I say it again. The only way to stop most cheats is to prevent the cheats it self. They still can manipulate the devices with macros no question about, but most common cheats like wall hack or aimbot wouldn't exsit anymore. I didn't speak about detection anyway but it seems you don't even know the real problem. PUBG banned 20 million accounts so detection isn't the problem. The problem is to keep them out after. If you think your server sided system is able to detect cheat again, you must be kidding for sure. But you don't counter ask your own stuff. Ask, why Valorant didn't use such effective ways to stop the bad circle of create account --> ban -- create a new account ? They don't benefit from the cheater in any way because the game is free to play so they should have the biggest focus to keep them out.",2020-10-06T19:06:15.573000+00:00

<@!346486348884213770>  True. But I believe that most (console players) had indicated they would put up with longer matchmaking times to get maps they'd prefer to play. And those longer matchmaking times for Map Selection are actually LESS than loading into a match, seeing it's Miramar (or whatever), waiting for the whole squad to back out (after those on OG's or no SSD's have to actually load first before they can back out), and then starting the process over again.",2020-10-02T17:15:24.761000+00:00

572,TerminatorCow#0438,"I just want to ping out a general issue which frustrates me a lot, it is not an issue that is recent, but an issue with a greater history:

The communication between the developers and the player base is really bad compared to other games. For example, a form of dad communication is the recent announcement regarding ""the investigation of issues relating to client & server performance"" (reference: https://twitter.com/PUBG_Support/status/1296310117382537216?s=20 or <#387827658777427969>). So, what I heard is that players are getting 100% CPU utilization, others are getting ping and packet loss issue. What I am asking myself, if the PUBG statement covers both issues, or one of the issues. After I mentioned the issue regarding higher ping (and packet loss) on EU servers (I experienced it myself, but after this announcement, around the 22th August), they did not reply. That has been always the way here at BlueHole, as information is released with unclear content regarding of precise descriptions of the investigation. This would also clear up the bug channel when the player base exaclty knows which issues are known by the developers, and which are not. It is just frustrating to read this twitter announcement and not being sure if my issues are part of this investigation or not.

I think I will jeeo this game uninstalled for a longer time period now. I am also leaving this group very soon. I always feel like I am talking to a wall. I know I am really tilted, and I just want to express my opinion here, and hope for the best.",2020-08-24T19:10:46.316000+00:00
573,TerminatorCow#0438,"Apart from this issue, let me make a summary about recen patches.

When I look back into the recent updates:
- Update 8.1 updated Sanhok, but messed up the loot tables on all other maps
- Update 8.2, the current update, introduced issues regarding ""client and server performance""
- there are more things like: introducing blood changes -> performance issues -> reverting that fix, the same for the gas can and so much other stuff that introduced new issues

In addition to this, some EU players from certain countries have suffered from routing issues some months ago, which was acknowledged MONTHS later and then got fixed (result: EU players had significant ping and packet loss issues). Sadly, I can not prove this information as there was an open thread on the forums, acknowledged by one or more of the PUBG Forum mods. 

To put this section into a nutshell: With nearly every update significant issues are being introduced. ATM I can and will not play, and if there would be a similar BR out there, I would gladly move to this and happily forget PUBG. It is just frustrating the last 6-9 months.

Gladly would see a Fix-PUBG campaign again. I think there needs to be core issues resolved, and these are even acknowledge by you: cheater and client/server performance. I do not think we need to talk about sound balancing/gun balancing, because we as user can only share our feelings, but you guys can have a more objective way of determining if a gun is overpowered or not with data collection. But please do anything to increase the player experience. I can only hope for the best, because atm the game is in a state, which is worse than ever and it is continuing to fall down.",2020-08-24T19:10:47.198000+00:00

790,tiltedbydefault#0186,"<@165746109837213697>  as far as im concerned , you either create an actual, proper skill based system (the season 7 one just gone was very decent) or you cater to all of the whiny people who play the game every day, arent very good so are in gold with a 1.2kd but they think theyre better than they are and they deserve master tier.. so you create a system where time played = higher rank, which is exactly what im worried youve just changed ranked to this season. its easy to see why devs would cater to all of these whiners, but what you have to realise is they know deep down they arent good enough but theyll keep playing and keep trying to get a higher rank because it actually means something .. you give everyone the top rank and suddenly it means nothing and people stop bothering. i grinded league of legends for 3 years and never got higher than low diamond.. its one of the most popular games ever made and the ranked system is punishing.. but everybody wants the highest ranks because you only get them if youre good enough, nothing to do with time played .. 

TLDR; please keep the ranked system skill based and ignore the whining masses who think they should be master cos they play all the time.. they will keep playing !",2020-07-23T15:56:39.349000+00:00

927,abranchi#8067,"Yesterday I came in and asked about the XP for leveling up once you finsh all your missions. I was kindly enough given the answer that by just playing you can get XP to advance in your battle pass journey. I had never actually looked into how much XP you win from just playing "" "". Yesterday I played a match, got 12 kills and a chicken dinner, got 290 XP. So I need approximately 35 matches like that one in order to advance 1 level (10.000 XP). Taking in consideration each match like that is around 20+ minutes (for the sake lf the argument, let's say 20 minutes), that means I need 11 hours and a hald approximately to advance one level in my battle pass. Taking in consideration everything, I believe this is unfair. We are paying for the battle pass and we are actually putting time in the game. Either put more missions into the thing, or make the daily missions worthy of more XP, or simply give us more XP from our matches. I understand you guys want to make money, but come on, this in particular is unfair for the players specially since we are putting money and time into the game. In Call of Duty if you buy one battle pass and you finish it all, you can actually get the coins you need from that battle pass FOR FREE and have enough to get the next battle pass, and it's actually pretty achievable. I have all the battle pass and I haven't put a cent into the game (the coins to buy the first battle pass came with the purchase of the game) maybe you guys could take somrthing of that into consideration. PLUS, if you want to buy levels, in case you didn't finish the battle pass, 20 levels go for the value of the battle pass, it just doesn't make any sense, it's absurd. <@165746109837213697> (I'm pinging you since you were the kne who answered to my first question about the XP).

However, it felt pretty bad to immediately lose that space when your vest was destroyed in combat. Your survivability also drastically decreased once your vest was destroyed. leaving you extremely vulnerable until you found a new one. With this change, ‘destroyed’ vests will no longer disappear, and neither will your inventory space.

> In addition, vests will continue to provide 20% protection and slight aim punch reduction once destroyed. The base protection level of the destroyed vest is the same no matter the type of vest you’re wearing. This should mean more competitive engagements, even if the situation doesn’t allow for the looting of a new vest.

I’ve had so many friends quit this game because of the excessive amount of cheating. Pubg profits off the hackers because they continue to pay for accounts when they are account banned.

Im tired of this rng bullshit.  Why should I sink thousands of bp into a crate if im just gonna pull dupes all day long.   Its fucking stupid.  And so is the proce on the cash weapin skins.  15 dollars for a skin when the game costs 30?   Its just greed,2019-11-23T21:30:13.342000+00:00

4887,highkick#2850,"Suggestion - can SP be carried over to perspective but remain in their category ?

Example: all sp gained in solo play applies to solo tpp/fpp . All sp gained in squads supplies to squad tpp/fpp

I only ask this because I prefer to play FPP,  but being a console player there are not always FPP games available when I play.  Ive been enjoying customs to get my FPP fix but it doesn't help me with my survivor pass or achievements.
 I  understand it's probably the way it is because tpp is an easier way to play just would be a quality of life upgrade for me and a few other people.

4904,Deoji#0001,"**Unreal Engine question for the game developers:**
__If this post is unwanted can somebody then refer me where to post feedback/suggestion to PUBG?__

Are you ever gonna remove the camera boom from the mesh? I know you will have to re-do years of work and that the game was inspired by tactical immersion (Arma 3) but that is also what makes the game feel clunky in FPP and truly unfit for E-sport. Ideal would be to change the accelerate amount, that way, years of work is not wasted. However, keeping the same amount for A-D spam

I'm basically talking about the momentum in the gameplay movement, from standing still to walking, to running. There are no inertia physics in Overwatch/CSGO for example. Right, sidestepping spam must be prevented, yes gamedesign is important. I understand

Now I know that the game was developed with TPP in focus (early development) but it will increase the E-sport engagement as most people prefer First Person, when it comes to competitive shooters. Yes, PUBG is a tactical game but inertia physics is unfit for first person E-Sport. True that this will also make PUBG more arcady

As for me, I have always liked PUBG and bought it in closed beta. I was just hoping that the movement, gameplay wise would change overtime, which also has been mentioned in one of the development blogs as well. I have seen no mention or update of it since then.

**[tl;dr]**
Doc and Shroud mentioned that the momentum in movement feels sluggish and clunky. Is there an update on whether they will change this in the future?

Every player can create challenges (most kills, most damage dealt, longest kill,...), if friends accept the challenge, the platform tracks progress and automatically determines the winner 🥇

I am now ready to invite a very limited circle of beta testers to the tool to gather important community feedback.

Please sign up here asap to save your spot: https://buddychallenge.pythonanywhere.com/

6120,3NFORC3R#1363,"imo there alot more to it, it changes the meta keeping the game moving and us picking up different weapons in the process. The beryl will slaughter anyone if you put the time into it.  ok so it takes 7+ shots on a level 3 vest. what does that do to a level 1, then what does that do to a level 1 with a noob wearing the vest. This change also helps survivability for everyone including the noobs and keeping them interested to keep the game moving up and not losing its player count.  None of us want to see this game go down the drain and little things like this need to be done to keep the new guys happy. like i said just imo",2019-09-13T06:37:04.090000+00:00
