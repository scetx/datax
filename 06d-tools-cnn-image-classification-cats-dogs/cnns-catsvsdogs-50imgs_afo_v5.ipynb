    "## Part 1-4: Build your own Cats vs Dogs binary classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will implement a binary Cats vs Dogs classifier by removing the top layer of a pretrained network (VGG16 on Imagenet), extracting the features of the training and validation images and then just training the top layer of that network. This way we will be able to make accurate predictions even though we just have a small data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want you to able to use the tools that we have presented so far. Therefore, in step 1-4 we want you to install Keras, extract the bottleneck features of your images, train the top layer and lastly make predicitons on images not presented to the CNN so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data conists of 2000 training images (1000 cats and 1000 dogs), 800 validation images (400 cats and 400 dogs), and 100 test images (cats and dogs mixed). Find the data here (or in the Github folder): https://www.dropbox.com/s/y2suimh2lt5btam/data.zip?dl=1\n",
    "\n",
    "The pretrained VGG16 weighs that you should load into your model (in order to extract the bottleneck features) can be downloaded here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/o7rxv6y2xf69jmw/vgg16_weights.h5?dl=0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we are using a pretrained network, extracting bottleneck features and training only the top layers is that this is a great way to obtain a high prediction accuracy without having to run the training for a long time. it would take up to several days to run this analysis and training your own CNN / DNN on a personal computer (in order to obtain the same level of accuracy).\n",

Such a network would have already learned features that are useful for most computer vision problems, and leveraging such features would allow us to reach a better accuracy than any method that would only rely on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the VGG16 architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Because the ImageNet dataset contains several \"cat\" classes (persian cat, siamese cat...) and many \"dog\" classes among its total of 1000 classes, this model will already have learned features that are relevant to our classification problem. In fact, it is possible that merely recording the softmax predictions of the model over our data rather than the bottleneck features would be enough to solve our dogs vs. cats classification problem extremely well. The method presented here is more likely to generalize well to a broader range of problems, including problems featuring classes absent from ImageNet.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy to extract bottleneck features:** We will only instantiate the convolutional part of the model, everything up to the fully-connected layers. We will then run this model on our training, validation and test data once, recording the output (the \"bottleneck features\" from the VGG16 model: the last activation maps before the fully-connected layers) in two numpy arrays. The reason why we are storing the features offline rather than adding our fully-connected model directly on top of a frozen convolutional base and running the whole thing, is computational effiency. Running VGG16 is expensive, especially if you're working on CPU, and we want to only do it once. Note, therefore we will not use data augmentation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The right tool for an image classification job is a convnet, so let's try to train one on our data, as an initial baseline. Since we only have few examples, our number one concern should be overfitting. Overfitting happens when a model exposed to too few examples learns patterns that do not generalize to new data, i.e. when the model starts using irrelevant features for making predictions. For instance, if you, as a human, only see three images of people who are lumberjacks, and three, images of people who are sailors, and among them only one lumberjack wears a cap, you might start thinking that wearing a cap is a sign of being a lumberjack as opposed to a sailor. You would then make a pretty lousy lumberjack/sailor classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation is one way to fight overfitting, but it isn't enough since our augmented samples are still highly correlated. Your main focus for fighting overfitting should be the entropic capacity of your model --how much information your model is allowed to store. A model that can store a lot of information has the potential to be more accurate by leveraging more features, but it is also more at risk to start storing irrelevant features. Meanwhile, a model that can only store a few features will have to focus on the most significant features found in the data, and these are more likely to be truly relevant and to generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to modulate entropic capacity. The main one is the choice of the number of parameters in your model, i.e. the number of layers and the size of each layer. Another way is the use of weight regularization, such as L1 or L2 regularization, which consists in forcing model weights to taker smaller values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we will use a very small convnet with few layers and few filters per layer, alongside data augmentation and dropout. Dropout also helps reduce overfitting, by preventing a layer from seeing twice the exact same pattern, thus acting in a way analoguous to data augmentation (you could say that both dropout and data augmentation tend to disrupt random correlations occuring in your data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet below is our first model, a simple stack of 3 convolution layers with a ReLU activation and followed by max-pooling layers. This is very similar to the architectures that Yann LeCun advocated in the 1990s for image classification (with the exception of ReLU)."

    "In Keras this can be done via the keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator class. This class allows you to:\n",

    "configure random transformations and normalization operations to be done on your image data during training\n",
